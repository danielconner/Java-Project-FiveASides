# Java-Project-FiveASides

This project was developed using Java, PSQL, Heroku and Spark.

the aim for the app was presnt users with a list of games of 5'a'sides in their area that needed players.

you are also able view what games a player has signed up for and what players have signed up for games.

there are a few bugs needed fixed on the app, but considering it was built in 5 days, I am happy with the content.

the site is available at http://find-a-sides.herokuapp.com/login 

you can sign up and then sign up with your username. 

or alternatively you can sign in with the username "Stevey" and this will give you access to the app.

any questions to dannyconner@hotmail.co.uk
